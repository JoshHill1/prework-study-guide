# prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation and purpose of this project was built to familiarize myself with how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript works. It answers the question of what notes I took during the bootcamp and shows how I put them to use. I learned the fundamental building blocks to creating and publishing a website.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If we open the DevTools console by inspecting the elements and going to the control panel, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
